# Portfolio Website - [Jasper LeeðŸŒŸ]
Welcome to my portfolio website! This repository contains the code and resources for my personal portfolio, where I showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. This website was created following an example by a YouTuber [(CodeBucks)]("https://devdreaming.com/videos/nextjs-tutorial-build-portfolio-tailwind-css-framer-motion#code-links"), with customizations to better reflect my personal style and preferences. <br />

## Introduction

- **About**: A more indepth section about myself, containing my biography and professional skills.
- **Projects**: Highlights of my key projects, including links to demos and Github Repositories.
- **CV**: A summary of my professional experiences and education. 
-  **Dark Mode** : Togglable button to switch between Light and Dark Mode.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS 
- Next.js
- Framer-motion
- JavaScript

## Customization
This project was initially inspired by Youtuber Codebuck's tutorial. However, I have customized this project to remove sections that didn't fit what I wanted. <br />
Some of the sections from the original tutorial were not implemented at this time. I do have plans to further update and improve this portfolio in the future. <br />

### Future Ideas
I have plans to further enhance this portfolio website in the future. Some of the improvements I plan to implement include:
1. Merged Multiple Pages: Transition from separate pages to a single page, scrollable page design for seamless navigation.
2. Scroll Progress Indicator: Add a [Scroll Animation](https://www.framer.com/motion/scroll-animations/) which tells the user if they are at the end of the page.
